Assignment 1: Floating point arithmetic



1. Write code in C to find the epsilon of the machine for both the float and double types.

2. Write code in Python or your favorite language (octave, scilab etc.) to find the epsilon of the machine.

3. Plot the function
f(x)=(1−cos(x))/(x∗x)
in the region [-4e-8 <= x <= 4e-8] using your favorite programming language.  Plot the correct curve and show how you obtain it.

4. Write out the finite difference form for the first derivative of a f(x) with a first order approximation (forward or backward), second order (O(h^2)) and fourth order approximation.

5. Consider f(x) = sin(x) at the point x=pi/4.  Start with h=pi/4, compute the value of the first derivative for each scheme.  Keep halving h and compute the relative error between the computed value of the derivative and the exact value as you successively halve h.  Plot this on a log-log scale.
